# Introduction to Application Layers
This article summarized the basic components of an application and their breakdown
along with an understanding of different layers in the software stack.

## What does an application need to run?

1. CPU
2. Memory
3. Disk Space
4. Network
5. OS
6. Application
7. Application Configuration


## Requirements
Each application requirement may be different but can be broken down into 3 categories
starting from the system up:

- Constant requirements
- Optional requirements
- Application specific requirements

### Constant
These are requirements that essential to all applications i.e. resources that the
application cannot function without.

- 1. CPU
- 2. Memory

### Optional
These are requirements based on the function of the application and may not be
needed by all software.

- 3. Disk Space
- 4. Network

### Application
These are requirements that are very specific to the application.

- 5. OS
- 6. Application
- 7. Application Configuration

## Approach
Each requirement above is tackled in the reverse order starting with the [Application](#application)
first and working our way up to [Constant](#constant) requirements.
